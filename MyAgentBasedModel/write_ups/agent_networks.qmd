Initially, the model considers a complete Agent-Agent interaction network.

We start with two identical models initialized with the exact same seed so that

- Agents are in the same positions
- Media are in the same positions
- Influencers are in the same positions

. . .

All other parameters being exactly equal.


# Everyone interacts with everyone

```{julia}
omp = OpinionModelProblem((-2.0, 2.0), (-2.0, 2.0); seed=201123)
X, Y, Z, C, R = solve(omp)

plot_evolution(X, Y, Z, C)
```

# Everyone interacts only within their clicque

```{julia}
omp = OpinionModelProblem((-2.0, 2.0), (-2.0, 2.0); seed=201123, AgAgNetF=_ag_ag_echo_chamber)
Xe, Ye, Ze, Ce, Re = solve(omp)

plot_evolution(Xe, Ye, Ze, Ce)
```

-----

It's hard to tell a difference, they both look almost the same. The one with the
echo chamber effect exhibits a "lateral spreading".

. . .

The idea was to use Wasserstein distances to measure how different the
distributions are.

# Conclusion (?)

- The main effect is still the attraction excerted by media outlets

- The spreading may have to do with how the agents feel attraction to their
influencer.

- The spreading differences persist even if I move the media agencies closer to
the center.
